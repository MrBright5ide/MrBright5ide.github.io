		<p>
			If you need a guy to make a game, sound effects, great levels, basic programs, websites, edit images, or 3d
			models, he's your man. If you
			need someone that can do more, he can also do it. Seriously, he wants to learn. For example, I made the
			basics for this website as part
			of a website design class, with a few of my own ideas thrown in. If you haven't already, hit refresh a
			couple times to see what I mean.

		<h2>
			Welcome to my sandbox on the web
		</h2>

		<p>
			If you're here, that either means you found this on complete accident, or you came looking for me. Either
			way, I hope you enjoy what you find. Since I
			know HTML, CSS, and the basics of javascript, I figured I could use this as an online portfolio and showcase
			those skills, while showing off other skills I
			have.
			<br />
			Also, you may notice that not all the pages have been updated. The reason for this is that I have decided to make this home page as pretty as possible, and will then copy it over to the other pages.<br /><br />
			The skills you can find pages for will be:
