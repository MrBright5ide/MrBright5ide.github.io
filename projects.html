	<h1>Spinefrost Studios</h1>
		<p>Not every thing we work on is a game. It might be a tool we use, or maybe a way to bring the world together in a very simple way. These are projects that we intend to work on, however, we hope that we can collaborate with another party to complete. These ideas are copyright free in hopes that regardless of who completes them, that they will in fact be completed.</p>

		<div class="projtit">Project Network</div>
		<p>If you have never played any of the Mega Man: Battle Network games, then you probably don't know how in that world, you can connect to almost anything by plugging in your PErsonal Terminal(PET) to a jack. In the real world, we have personal terminals, but not exclusively for connecting to random devices. Instead, we use them to connect to cell towers to send and receive texts and phones calls, update Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc., and connect to the internet to interact with others.</p>
		<p>Why not bring the two together to create a world where one can seamlessly pull relevant information about where you are, from where you are?</p>
		<p>Project Network would entail programming servers to be run on Raspberry Pi's, and connected to with mobile devices via bluetooth. On the mobile device, you'll control your own personalized avatar, which can connect to these local servers scattered throughout the world. Once inside, your avatar can run around, explore, talk to programs(non-controllable characters), upgrade your avatar, and collect virtual money. It is still undecided s to whether avatars can encounter virus as in the Mega Man: Battle Network games.</p>
